## Overview  
<hr>  
Cryptography is a tool used more often than realized.  For example, SSH keys used on a computer are asymmetric ciphers and use algorthims like RSA.  The conceptual process is often described but how the math works for even simple, outdated processes is rarely provided.    This repo explores the mathematical processes involved in a simple Diffie-Hellman Key.
